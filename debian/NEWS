php5 (5.2.0+dfsg-8+etch16) oldstable-security; urgency=high

  * Maximum number of file uploads per request limited

  To prevent Denial of Service attacks by exhausting the number of
  available temporary file names, the max_file_uploads option
  introduced in PHP 5.3.1 has been backported.

  Due to the nature of this new option a default limit has been set
  to 50, hoping it is sensible enough to not to cause disruptions on
  existing services.
  The value of this new limit can be changed in the php.ini file.

  If you installed the php5-suhosin extension there was a limiting
  mechanism in place already. In this case you may want to make sure
  the new limit imposed by PHP itself is not smaller than suhosin's.

php5 (5.1.6-5) unstable; urgency=low

  the debian php packages now support a modular configuration layout.

  if you have previously installed modules that have put entries in
  your php.ini file, you will probably be getting various warning
  messages about duplicate modules if you have error reporting enabled
  with a mask including E_WARN.

  no attempt will be made to muck further with your php.ini file, so you
  should remove those lines yourself.
