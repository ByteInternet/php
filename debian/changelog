php7.0 (7.0.0~beta2-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Initial packaging of PHP 7.0 - DON'T USE IN PRODUCTION
  * Imported Upstream version 7.0.0~beta2
  * Rebased patches on top of 7.0.0~beta2
  * Don't compile the PHP modules from this source package, but create
    phpX.Y-modules-source (Thanks Adam Conrad for the idea) that could be
    used to compiled modules from php-modules source package
  * Move phpenmod, phpquery, php-maintscript-helper and sessionclean to php-common package
  * Finish moving everything from /usr/share/php (save it just for PEAR)
  * Make the copyright machine readable (it might not be complete, but
    it's much better than we have now in src:php5)
  * Introduces complete rewrite of PHP packaging, so it might break horribly
  * Add d/NEWS with prominent experimental notices
  * Re-enable native JSON extension
