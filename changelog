php7.0 (7.0.0~beta1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Initial packaging of PHP 7.0 - DON'T USE IN PRODUCTION
  * Make the copyright machine readable (it might not be complete, but
    it's much better than we have now in src:php5)
  * Introduces complete rewrite of PHP packaging, so it might break horribly
  * Add d/NEWS with prominent experimental notices
  * Re-enable native JSON extension
